                                  The goal of this project is to create a Django web-based learning platform that gives students access to learning materials and a safe, anonymous way to post questions. Students can log in to the platform and view subjects and lessons in accordance with their respective departments. Each lesson comes with a YouTube video to view the lecture and anonymous question box so that students may post questions anonymously without giving away their identities. Anyone may respond to a question, fostering a collaborative learning environment. When a student posts a question, the app notifies the faculty via mail, guaranteeing that all student issues are handled right away. Also, college administration can invest in professional training programmes and make them accessible to students so they can access them and advance their knowledge. Our approach seeks to promote student productivity and increase the effectiveness of their time use by offering a single platform for accessing educational resources.
